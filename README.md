Project Overview

Project Title: Magento E-Commerce Dashboard Development

Objective: To create an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights into key e-commerce metrics, such as sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory management. The goal was to enable better decision-making and track business performance efficiently.

Context: The e-commerce company needed a centralized reporting solution to monitor various aspects of their online store, including sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance. The existing reporting system was either too slow or not sufficiently detailed.

•	Centralize Data: Integrate data from multiple sources into a single Power BI dashboard.

•	Visualize Key Metrics: Create visualizations for sales performance, customer insights, and inventory status.

•	Enable Interactivity: Provide interactive features like filters and drill-downs for detailed analysis.

Requirements:

•	Data Integration: Connect Power BI to various data sources such as sales databases, CRM systems, and inventory management tools.

•	Dashboard Features: Include charts, tables, and KPIs to track sales, revenue, customer acquisition, and product performance.

•	User Accessibility: Ensure the dashboard is user-friendly and accessible to stakeholders across different departments.


Data Sources and Integration

Data Sources:

•	Sales Data: Information on transactions, including order IDs, product details, quantities, and prices.

•	Customer Data: Details about customers, such as demographics, purchase history, and behavior.

•	Inventory Data: Information on product stock levels, categories, and suppliers.

Integration:

•	Data Connections: Used Power BI's built-in connectors to link to SQL databases, Excel files, and CRM systems.
